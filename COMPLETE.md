Have to figure out common code so that I can use only ONE component file for Each category: 1) Lean-to's, 2) A-Frames, 3) Diagonals, 4) Tents

```js
// variables for all:
const mults = [0, 0.25, 0.333, 0.375, 0.5, 0.667, 0.678, 0.75, 0.857, 1];
const angles = [22.5, 27, 27.5, 30, 33, 33.3, 37, 38, 39, 40, 45, 50, 53, 55, 56, 58, 60, 67.5, 75];
```
